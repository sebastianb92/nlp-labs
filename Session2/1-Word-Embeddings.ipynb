        "- **Mayor variabilidad** en los scores compound (ya no todo es neutral).\n",

        "\n",
        "El enfoque de **traducción + VADER** es práctico en un entorno académico de análisis de sentimientos en español, pero pierde algunos matices culturales y no se recomienda esta aproximación en un entorno real. Se captura de mejor manera la polaridad general de los mensajes comparado con el tratamiento de los mensajes originales en español y permite identificar patrones de comunicación entre los participantes del chat político analizado."
